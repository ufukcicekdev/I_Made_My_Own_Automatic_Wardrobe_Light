# DIY Automatic Wardrobe Light (No Arduino – No Sensor)

This is a simple and compact DIY wardrobe light powered by batteries and LEDs.
There is NO Arduino and NO motion sensor used in this project.
The light is controlled by a mechanical trigger when the door opens or closes.

Designed to be cheap, easy, and fast to build using 3D printed parts.

## 🔌 How It Works

The batteries power the LEDs directly.
When the wardrobe door is opened, the mechanical button/trigger is released and the LEDs turn ON.
When the door is closed, the button is pressed and the LEDs turn OFF.

This makes it very simple, reliable, and power efficient.
